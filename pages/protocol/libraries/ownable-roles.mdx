# OwnableRoles

**[`solady/src/auth/OwnableRoles.sol`](https://github.com/vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/auth/OwnableRoles.sol)**

Contract ownership and access roles management class.

Multiple roles are granted, revoked, accessed via 256-bit bitmaps (binary-OR result) of their flags.

## Write Functions

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual
```

Transfers contract ownership to `newOwner`.

**Calling conditions:**

- The caller must be the owner of the contract.

| Params:    |                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `newOwner` | The new owner of the contract. |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public virtual
```

Renounces contract ownership.

**Calling conditions:**

- The caller must be the owner of the contract.

### requestOwnershipHandover

```solidity
function requestOwnershipHandover() public virtual
```

Request a two-step ownership handover to the caller.  
The request will be automatically expire in 48 hours.

### cancelOwnershipHandover

```solidity
function cancelOwnershipHandover() public virtual
```

Cancels the two-step ownership handover to the caller, if any.

### completeOwnershipHandover

```solidity
function completeOwnershipHandover(address pendingOwner) public virtual
```

Allows the owner to complete the two-step ownership handover to `pendingOwner`.  
Reverts if there is no existing ownership handover requested by `pendingOwner`.

| Params:        |                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pendingOwner` | The address which requested the two-step ownership handover. |

### grantRoles

```solidity
function grantRoles(address user, uint256 roles) public virtual
```

Allows the owner to grant `user` `roles`.  
If the `user` already has a role, then it will be a no-op for the role.

**Calling conditions:**

- The caller must be the owner of the contract.

| Params: |                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `user`  | The address to grant the roles to.     |
| `roles` | The bitmap of the role flags to grant. |

### revokeRoles

```solidity
function revokeRoles(address user, uint256 roles) public virtual
```

Allows the owner to remove `user` `roles`.  
If the `user` does not have a role, then it will be a no-op for the role.

**Calling conditions:**

- The caller must be the owner of the contract.

| Params: |                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `user`  | The address to grant the roles to.      |
| `roles` | The bitmap of the role flags to revoke. |

### renounceRoles

```solidity
function renounceRoles(uint256 roles) public virtual
```

Allow the caller to remove their own roles.  
If the caller does not have a role, then it will be a no-op for the role.

| Params: |                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `roles` | The bitmap of the role flags to renounce. |

## Read-only Functions

### owner

```solidity
function owner() public view virtual returns (address)
```

Returns the owner of the contract.

### ownershipHandoverExpiresAt

```solidity
function ownershipHandoverExpiresAt(
    address pendingOwner
) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

Returns the expiry timestamp for the two-step ownership handover to `pendingOwner`.

### ownershipHandoverValidFor

```solidity
function ownershipHandoverValidFor() public view returns (uint256);
```

Returns how long a two-step ownership handover is valid for in seconds.

### hasAllRoles

```solidity
function hasAllRoles(
    address user,
    uint256 roles
) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

Returns whether `user` has all of `roles`.

### rolesOf

```solidity
function rolesOf(address user) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

Returns the roles of `user`.

### rolesFromOrdinals

```solidity
function rolesFromOrdinals(
    uint8[] memory ordinals
) public pure returns (uint256)
```

Convenience function to return a `roles` bitmap from the `ordinals`.  
This is meant for frontends like Etherscan, and is therefore not fully optimized.  
Not recommended to be called on-chain.

### ordinalsFromRoles

```solidity
function ordinalsFromRoles(
    uint256 roles
) public pure returns (uint8[] memory)
```

Convenience function to return an array of `ordinals` from the `roles` bitmap.  
This is meant for frontends like Etherscan, and is therefore not fully optimized.  
Not recommended to be called on-chain.

## Events

### OwnershipTransferred

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner)
```

The contract ownership is transferred from `oldOwner` to `newOwner`.

| `oldOwner` | The old owner of the contract. |
| `newOwner` | The new owner of the contract. |

### OwnershipHandoverRequested

```solidity
event OwnershipHandoverRequested(address indexed pendingOwner)
```

| `pendingOwner` | The pending owner of the contract. |

### RolesUpdated

```solidity
event RolesUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 indexed roles)
```

The `user`'s roles is updated to `roles`.
