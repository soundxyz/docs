# Sound Protocol

The Sound Protocol is a permissionless, open-source, modular smart contract framework for efficient creation of digital collectibles by musicians, artists, and creators.

[Sound Protocol Github repo](https://github.com/soundxyz/sound-protocol)

## Features

### Permissionless

<IndentedParagraph>
  Anyone can freely deploy and manage NFT contracts on the Sound Protocol. The latest contracts are not ownable contracts. All logic in the new contracts are made to be as general as possible. Any platform can build bespoke logic on Sound Protocol simply through configuration.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Non-upgradeable contracts

<IndentedParagraph>
  All contracts are non-upgradeable, which gives artists and collectors greater confidence in the security and
  sovereignty of the communities they can build on Sound.

### Customizable metadata

<IndentedParagraph>
  Artists and developers are free to implement custom metadata modules to suit their needs.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Customizable mint formats

<IndentedParagraph>
  Mint formats can be customized on a per-song basis by utilizing minter module contracts.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Customizable payments & royalties

<IndentedParagraph>
  With each song as its own contract, Sound Protocol supports end-to-end royalties across primary and secondary sales.
  Any address can be set to receive the edition’s revenue, be it the artist’s wallet or a payment splitter contract.
